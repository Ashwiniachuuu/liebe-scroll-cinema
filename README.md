# Liebe Scroll Cinema

Create a single-page premium futuristic 3D food website called **“LIEBE”**, inspired by the provided reference image. **Do NOT create a generic 2D restaurant website.**

## Design

* Premium white / off-white background

* Clean luxury white theme

* Premium glassmorphism with translucent white glass panels

* Subtle warm beige / soft golden accents

* Realistic high-quality burger and food visuals

* 3D depth, reflections, soft shadows and cinematic lighting

* Apple-style premium minimal design

* Smooth scrolling

* Scroll-based parallax and subtle 3D animations

* High contrast text using black / dark charcoal

* Bright, elegant and sophisticated food-brand aesthetic

## IMPORTANT — SCROLL-CONTROLLED BACKGROUND VIDEO

I will upload a **background food animation video**. Use the uploaded video as the **main full-screen background visual across the entire landing page**.

The video must behave as a **scroll-driven animation**, NOT as a normal autoplay background video.

### Video + Scroll Behavior

* Use the uploaded video as the main cinematic background from:

  **Home → Menu → Offers → About → Contact**

* The video should remain visually connected across the entire landing page.

* Divide the video's timeline proportionally across the five sections:

  * Home → approximately 0–20%

  * Menu → approximately 20–40%

  * Offers → approximately 40–60%

  * About → approximately 60–80%

  * Contact → approximately 80–100%

* As the user scrolls down, the video timeline must move forward smoothly.

* As the user scrolls up, the video timeline must move backward smoothly.

* **The user's scroll position must directly control the video timeline.**

* Do NOT allow the video to independently autoplay.

* Do NOT use normal video playback for the scroll animation.

* Do NOT let the video restart when entering a new section.

* Do NOT pause/freeze the video when reaching the navbar or section boundaries.

* The video must continue seamlessly between all sections.

* The entire video should feel like **one continuous cinematic animation controlled by scrolling**.

### Smooth Scroll Synchronization

Make the video movement extremely smooth and synchronized with the user's scrolling.

Use:

* `requestAnimationFrame`

* Smooth interpolation / lerping

* `video.currentTime`

* `loadedmetadata`

* Proper video preloading

* Scroll-progress calculation

* Clamped progress values from `0` to `1`

Avoid:

* Directly assigning `video.currentTime` on every raw scroll event

* Jitter

* Frame skipping

* Stuttering

* Sudden jumps

* Freezing near section boundaries

* Video restarting

* Timeline desynchronization

The scroll position should control a normalized progress value:

`scrollProgress = scrollY / (documentHeight - viewportHeight)`

Then map:

`video.currentTime = scrollProgress * video.duration`

Use smooth interpolation so the video follows the user's scrolling naturally without lag or sudden jumps.

### Critical Requirement

**The user controls the video entirely through scrolling.**

If the user scrolls slowly → the video animation moves slowly.

If the user scrolls quickly → the video smoothly moves forward according to the scroll position.

If the user stops scrolling → the video stops at exactly that point.

If the user scrolls upward → the video reverses smoothly.

The video must behave almost like a **3D scroll animation / image sequence**, while using the uploaded video as the source.

---

## IMPORTANT — LOCAL ASSETS / `src/assets` / GITHUB / KIRO

**All images and videos used by this website must be stored locally inside the project.**

This is a critical requirement.

### Asset Folder Structure

Create and use this structure:

```text

src/

└── assets/

    ├── videos/

    │   └── liebe-background.mp4

    ├── images/

    │   ├── cheese-burger.webp

    │   ├── spicy-chicken-burger.webp

    │   ├── double-beef-burger.webp

    │   ├── crispy-chicken.webp

    │   ├── loaded-fries.webp

    │   ├── drinks.webp

    │   └── ...

    └── ...

```

### Uploaded Video

The **video I upload must be stored inside**:

`src/assets/videos/`

For example:

`src/assets/videos/liebe-background.mp4`

Use this local file as the background scroll-controlled video.

**Do NOT use the uploaded video from a temporary Lovable URL.**

The final React application must reference the local asset.

### Lovable-Generated Images

Any images generated, selected or used by Lovable for:

* Burgers

* Food cards

* Fries

* Drinks

* Offers

* About section

* Hero visuals

* Other website visuals

must be stored inside:

`src/assets/images/`

**Do NOT depend on temporary Lovable-hosted image URLs.**

### No External Asset Dependency

Do NOT use external URLs for the main website images or background video.

Do NOT use:

* Temporary Lovable image URLs

* Temporary Lovable video URLs

* External CDN image URLs for the main food visuals

* Placeholder image URLs

All important visual assets must exist inside the project repository.

### React/Vite Asset Imports

Use local imports such as:

```js

import backgroundVideo from "./assets/videos/liebe-background.mp4";

import burgerImage from "./assets/images/cheese-burger.webp";

```

Use the imported local assets throughout the React application.

### GitHub Clone Requirement

The project must be completely **self-contained and GitHub-ready**.

When I push the project to GitHub and later clone it into **Kiro**, all images and the background video must still work.

The expected workflow is:

```text

Lovable

   ↓

GitHub

   ↓

Clone Repository

   ↓

Kiro

   ↓

npm install

   ↓

npm run dev

   ↓

Complete LIEBE website

```

After cloning into Kiro:

* All images must load.

* The background video must load.

* The scroll-controlled video must work.

* No asset should be missing.

* No temporary Lovable URL should be required.

* No manual asset download should be required after cloning.

### Final Asset Verification

Before completing the project, verify:

1. Uploaded video exists in `src/assets/videos/`.

2. All website images exist in `src/assets/images/`.

3. React components use local asset imports.

4. No important visual uses a temporary external URL.

5. Assets are included in the GitHub repository.

6. The website works after cloning into Kiro.

7. `npm run dev` works without missing asset errors.

8. The background video still works with scroll control after cloning.

**Treat `src/assets` as the single source of truth for all important images and videos.**

---

## White Background + Video Integration

The overall website must maintain a **premium white / off-white visual identity**.

The uploaded video should integrate naturally into the white design:

* Keep the surrounding background white / off-white.

* Do not create a black video background.

* Use white or transparent-looking visual treatment where possible.

* Add subtle white gradients or overlays around the video if necessary.

* Maintain readability of black/dark text over the video.

* Use soft beige/golden ambient lighting to blend the video with the design.

* Add subtle glassmorphism overlays where appropriate.

* The video should feel like a premium floating 3D food object rather than a conventional rectangular video.

If the uploaded video itself contains a dark background, use appropriate CSS masking, blending, gradients, cropping or layering techniques to visually integrate it into the white luxury theme without destroying the video quality.

---

## Performance

Keep the implementation lightweight and optimized.

* Do not duplicate the video for every section.

* Use **one shared background video element** for the entire landing page.

* Preload the video metadata and important frames.

* Avoid unnecessary React re-renders during scrolling.

* Use `requestAnimationFrame` for scroll/video synchronization.

* Keep animations GPU-friendly.

* Use transforms and opacity instead of expensive layout animations where possible.

* Ensure smooth performance on normal laptops and desktop browsers.

---

## Navbar

Create a floating transparent glass navbar with a premium white glass effect.

**LIEBE**

Home | Menu | Offers | About | Contact

Requirements:

* Sticky/floating navbar

* Smooth glassmorphism

* Subtle blur

* White translucent background

* Soft shadow

* Dark charcoal typography

* Warm beige/golden hover accent

* Navbar links should smoothly scroll to their respective sections.

* Scrolling through the navbar area must NOT freeze or interrupt the background video animation.

---

## Hero — Home

Create a fullscreen immersive 3D hero featuring a realistic juicy chicken burger with:

* Steam

* Floating particles

* Soft cinematic lighting

* Realistic reflections

* Realistic shadows

* Warm lighting

* Subtle smoke

* Premium food atmosphere

* Realistic depth

* White/luxury visual treatment

Heading:

**“Made Fresh. Made With Passion.”**

Add a short premium description about LIEBE.

Keep the section visually consistent with the white luxury theme.

The uploaded background video must continue seamlessly through this section without restarting or freezing.

Any images used in this section must be stored inside:

`src/assets/images/`

---

## Contact Section

Create a simple premium white glassmorphism contact section with:

**Location | Phone | Email | Opening Hours**

Use:

* Clean dark typography

* Subtle borders

* Soft shadows

* Minimal luxury styling

* White/off-white background

* Beige/golden accents

The video should smoothly reach the final portion of its timeline as the user scrolls toward Contact.

---

## Final CTA

Create a premium final CTA:

**“Ready for Your Next Craving?”**

**“One bite is all it takes.”**

Button:

**ORDER YOUR BURGER**

---

## Technical Requirements

Use:

* React

* Three.js

* React Three Fiber

* Framer Motion and/or GSAP

* CSS3

* HTML5 Video API

Keep everything as **ONE LANDING PAGE**.

Only implement:

**Home | Menu | Offers | About | Contact**

Use navbar anchor scrolling.

### Most Important Technical Goal

The website should feel like a **premium interactive 3D product experience**, where the uploaded video acts almost like a **scroll-controlled 3D animation**.

The final experience should be:

**Scroll Down → Video moves forward**

**Stop Scrolling → Video stops**

**Scroll Up → Video reverses**

**Continue Scrolling → Video continues from the exact current frame**

No autoplay.

No independent video playback.

No sudden jumps.

No freezing.

No timeline reset.

No section-by-section video restart.

The video should remain one continuous animation throughout:

**HOME → MENU → OFFERS → ABOUT → CONTACT**

The entire experience must feel smooth, cinematic, premium and user-controlled.

## Visual Quality

Focus heavily on:

* Realistic 3D food

* Cinematic lighting

* White luxury aesthetic

* Premium glassmorphism

* Smooth scroll animation

* Scroll-controlled background video

* Parallax effects

* 3D depth

* Realistic reflections and shadows

* High-end food photography

* Premium typography

* Modern Apple-style visual quality

* Smooth section transitions

* Seamless video-to-scroll synchronization

Avoid:

* Generic 2D restaurant layouts

* Multiple pages

* Login systems

* Cart systems

* Product-detail pages

* Complex backend functionality

* Unnecessary components

* Heavy libraries or unnecessary animations

**Keep the implementation lightweight to minimize credit usage while preserving the premium visual quality and smooth scroll-controlled video experience.**

## FINAL IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION

**Do not finish the implementation until the uploaded video and all important generated/used images are stored locally inside `src/assets` and referenced from there. The project must remain fully functional when pushed to GitHub and cloned into Kiro.**
IMPORTANT — LOCAL ASSETS FOR GITHUB / KIRO

Store the uploaded video in src/assets/videos/.

Store all Lovable-generated or selected images in src/assets/images/.

Use only these local assets in the React/Vite code.

Do not use temporary Lovable URLs or external URLs for important images/videos.

Make sure all assets are included in GitHub so the website works after cloning into Kiro with npm install and npm run dev.

No manual asset download should be required after cloning.

Do not change the existing UI, design, layout, animations, colors, or functionality.

CRITICAL — ONE CONTINUOUS SCROLL-CONTROLLED VIDEO

Use the exact uploaded video as ONE shared video across:

HOME → MENU → OFFERS → ABOUT → CONTACT

The video must be 100% controlled by the user's page scrolling:

Scroll Down → Video moves forward
Scroll Up → Video reverses
Stop Scrolling → Video stops at the current frame

Use one <video> element, video.currentTime, requestAnimationFrame, loadedmetadata, and smooth interpolation.

Map the entire page scroll progress (0–100%) to the entire video timeline (0–100%).

No autoplay.

Do not use video.play().

Do not restart the video between sections.

Do not create separate videos for each section.

Do not freeze, jump, skip, or reset the timeline.

Navbar section clicks must smoothly scroll while the video follows the same timeline.

The video must remain continuous from Home → Menu → Offers → About → Contact.

Do not change anything in the existing UI or visual design. Only implement this scroll-controlled video behavior and local asset handling.
